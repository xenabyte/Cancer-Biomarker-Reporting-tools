                        <p>The transition from sigmoid to rectum is marked by the fusion of the tenia coli of the sigmoid to form the circumferential longitudinal muscle of the rectal wall approximately 12&nbsp;to 15 cm from the dentate line. The rectum is defined clinically as the distal large intestine commencing opposite the sacral promontory and ending at the anorectal ring, which corresponds to the proximal border of the puborectalis muscle palpable on digital rectal examination<sup>1</sup> (Figure 2). When measuring below with a rigid sigmoidoscope, it extends 16 cm from the anal verge.</p>

                        <p>Tumors located at the border between two subsites of the colon (eg, cecum and ascending colon) are registered as tumors of the subsite that is more involved. If two subsites are involved to the same extent, the tumor is classified as an "overlapping" lesion.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A tumor is classified as rectal if its inferior margin lies less than 16 cm from the anal verge or if any part of the tumor is located at least partly within the supply of the superior rectal artery.<sup>3 </sup>The rectum commences at the sacral promontory, and the junction of sigmoid colon and rectum is anatomically marked by fusion of tenia coli to form the circumferential longitudinal muscle of the rectal wall. Intraoperatively, the rectosigmoid junction corresponds to the sacral promontory. A tumor is classified as rectosigmoid when differentiation between rectum and sigmoid according to the previously mentioned guidelines is not possible.<sup>4 </sup></p>
                        <p><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
                        <p>Anteriorly, the peritoneal reflection is located at the junction of middle and lower third of the rectum, while laterally, it is located at the junction of upper and middle third of the rectum. Posteriorly, the reflection is located higher and most of the posterior rectum does not have a serosal covering.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>(a) Whether an adenocarcinoma located in the rectum has a circumferential resection (radial) margin (CRM) or a peritoneal (serosal) surface depends on its location&nbsp;in relation&nbsp;to the peritoneal reflections. Tumors below the anterior peritoneal reflection will have a 360-degree CRM, while those above it may have a CRM or a peritoneal (serosal) surface, or both, depending on the precise location.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        (b) Neoadjuvant therapy and mesorectal excision&nbsp;are considered&nbsp;standard of care for rectal adenocarcinomas &ldquo;below the anterior peritoneal reflection,&rdquo; while the opinions about use of these modalities vary about rectal adenocarcinomas located above the anterior peritoneal reflection. Conservative options like transanal disc excisions are often considered for location &ldquo;below the anterior peritoneal reflection.&rdquo; In these contexts, the peritoneal reflection refers to the junction of upper and middle third of the rectum; there is ongoing debate in the surgical literature about the concept of peritoneal reflection.<sup>5</sup> If information about tumor location with respect to the peritoneal reflection is included in the report,&nbsp;the&nbsp;aspect of rectum in question (posterior, lateral, anterior)&nbsp;should also be noted.</li>

                        <p>The histologic types of colorectal carcinoma that have been shown to have adverse prognostic significance independent of stage are signet-ring cell carcinoma<sup>7</sup> and small cell carcinoma (poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma).<sup>8</sup></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Medullary carcinoma is a distinctive histologic type strongly associated with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), indicative of defects in normal DNA repair gene function. Medullary carcinoma may occur either sporadically or in association with Lynch syndrome.<sup>9-11 </sup>This tumor type is characterized by solid growth in nested, organoid, or trabecular patterns, with no immunohistochemical evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation. Medullary carcinomas are also characterized by numerous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and a better prognosis.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Micropapillary carcinoma is characterized by small, tight clusters of tumor cells in cleft-like spaces, and is often present in association with conventional adenocarcinoma. This variant is strongly associated with lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis.<sup>12</sup></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Serrated adenocarcinomas are characterized by neoplastic glands showing prominent serrations, tumor cells with basal nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, and no or minimal luminal necrosis. These tumors are thought to be related to traditional serrated adenomas and may have a more aggressive course than conventional adenocarcinoma.<sup>13</sup></p>

                    <div class="modal-body">
                        <p>A number of grading systems for colorectal cancer have been suggested, but a single widely accepted and uniformly used standard for grading is lacking. Most systems stratify tumors into 3 or 4 grades as follows:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Grade 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well differentiated (&gt;95% gland formation)</p>
                        <p>Grade 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moderately differentiated (50-95% gland formation)</p>
                        <p>Grade 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poorly differentiated (&lt;50% gland formation)</p>
                        <p>Grade 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undifferentiated (no gland formation or mucin; no squamous or neuroendocrine differentiation)</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Despite a significant degree of interobserver variability<sup>14 </sup>histologic grade has been shown to be an important prognostic factor in many studies,<sup>15,16</sup> with strong correlation between poor differentiation and adverse outcome.<sup>17</sup> While some studies have stratified grade into a two-tiered low- and high-grade system, a three- or four-tier system is more commonly used for gastrointestinal carcinomas.&nbsp; The AJCC has specified use of a four-tiered grading system for colorectal cancer for the 8<sup>th</sup> edition of the TNM manual.<sup>1</sup> Pathologists should use the four-tier histologic grading scheme as specified above to prevent errors in data recording. As per WHO, the grading scheme applies to adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, and not to histologic variants. For example, medullary carcinomas behave as low grade tumors even though they may appear poorly differentiated. This grading scheme is also not applicable to poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas.</p>

                    <h2>D.&nbsp; Carcinoma in an Adenomatous Polyp: Microscopic Tumor Extension and High-Risk Features</h2>
                    <p>Colorectal adenomas containing invasive adenocarcinoma that extends through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa have been defined as <em>malignant polyps.</em><sup>14</sup> This term encompasses cases in which the entire polyp head is replaced by carcinoma and adenomas with focal malignancy, but the definition excludes adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma (invasive carcinoma limited to the lamina propria or invading no deeper than the muscularis mucosa), because these polyps possess negligible biological potential for metastasis (see Tis in Note M).</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Malignant polyps removed by endoscopic polypectomy require evaluation of histologic factors related to the risk of adverse outcome (ie, lymph node metastasis or local recurrence from residual malignancy) following polypectomy.<sup>18-20</sup> Factors shown to have independent prognostic significance and are important in determining the need for further surgical treatment include:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Histologic grade</li>
                    <li>Status of the resection margin</li>
                    <li>Lymphatic/venous vessel involvement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>An increased risk of adverse outcome has been shown to be associated with:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>High-grade carcinoma</li>
                    <li>Tumor at or less than 1 mm from the resection margin</li>
                    <li>Lymphatic/venous vessel involvement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Reporting of additional histologic factors that have been advocated for assessing risk include tumor budding (note F), depth or area of submucosal invasion. Submucosal involvement has been divided into superficial, mid and deep levels for sessile polyps (Kikuchi levels sm1, sm2 and sm3) for sessile polyps,<sup>21</sup> and into four levels (head, neck, stalk and beyond stalk) in pedunculated polyps (Haggitt levels).<sup>22</sup> Based on measurement, submucosal invasion more than 1mm has been recognized as an adverse prognostic factor.<sup>20</sup> However, it can be difficult to accurately assess the depth or extent of submucosal involvement due to improper orientation and absence of muscularis propria in these specimens.</p>
                    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
                    <h2>E.&nbsp; Lymph-Vascular and Perineural Invasion</h2>
                    <p>It is recommended that small vessel vascular invasion should be reported separately from venous (large vessel) invasion. Small vessel invasion indicates tumor involvement of thin-walled structures lined by endothelium, without an identifiable smooth muscle layer or elastic lamina. Small vessels include lymphatics, capillaries, and postcapillary venules. Small vessel invasion is associated with lymph node metastasis and has been shown to be independent indicator of adverse outcome in several studies.<sup>23,24</sup> The higher prognostic significance of extramural small vessel invasion has been suggested,<sup>25</sup> but the importance of anatomic location in small vessel invasion (extramural or intramural) is not well defined.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Tumor involving endothelium-lined spaces with an identifiable smooth muscle layer or elastic lamina is considered venous (large vessel) invasion. Circumscribed tumor nodules surrounded by an elastic lamina on hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) or elastic stain are also considered venous invasion. Venous invasion can be extramural (beyond muscularis propria) or intramural (submucosa or muscularis propria). Extramural venous invasion has been demonstrated by multivariate analysis to be an independent adverse prognostic factor in multiple studies and is a risk factor for liver metastasis.<sup>25</sup> The significance of intramural venous invasion is less clear. Histologic features like tumor deposits adjacent to arterioles (&ldquo;orphan arteriole&rdquo; sign) and elongated tumor nodules extending into pericolic fat from the muscularis propria (&ldquo;protruding tongue&rdquo; sign) can raise the suspicion for venous invasion.<sup>26</sup> Elastic stain can lead to 2- to 3-fold increase in the detection of venous invasion, and may be used to improve assessment of this feature.<sup>27</sup></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Perineural invasion has been shown to be independent indicator of poor prognosis.<sup>28-30</sup> While some series did not find perineural invasion to be a significant predictive factor in stage II disease,<sup>31,32</sup> many studies have confirmed its adverse effect on survival in stage II disease.<sup>24,33</sup> Extramural perineural invasion may have a greater adverse prognostic effect,<sup>29</sup> but the distinction between intramural and extramural perineural invasion has not been well studied.</p>

                    <h4>F. Tumor Budding </h4>
                    <p>The presence of single cells or small clusters of less than five cells at the advancing front of the tumor is considered as peritumoral tumor budding. Numerous studies have shown that high tumor budding in adenocarcinoma arising in polyp is a significant risk factor for nodal involvement,<sup>20,34-38</sup> with tumor budding being the most significant factor in some studies.<sup>35</sup> Similarly, the adverse prognosis of high tumor budding has been shown in stage II patients and its inclusion as a high risk factor for making chemotherapy decisions for stage II patients has been advocated.<sup>36,38</sup> Different criteria for evaluating and reporting tumor budding have been followed in literature. An international tumor budding consensus conference (ITBCC) in 2016 recommended the following criteria for evaluating tumor budding<sup>39</sup>:</p>
                    <p>(1) Tumor budding counts should be done on H&amp;E sections. In cases of obscuring factors like inflammation, immunohistochemistry for keratin can be obtained to assess the advancing edge for tumor buds, but the scoring should be done on H&amp;E sections.</p>
                    <p>(2) Tumor budding should be reported by selecting a &ldquo;hotspot&rdquo; chosen after review of all available slides with invasive tumor. The total number of buds should be reported in an area measuring 0.785 mm<sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to 20x field in some microscopes (use appropriate conversion for other microscopes, see table below).</p>
                    <p>(3) Both total number of buds and a three-tier score (based on 0.785 mm<sup>2 </sup>field area) should be reported: low (0-4 &nbsp;buds), intermediate (5-9 buds) and high (10 or more buds).</p>
                    <p>This is not a required element, but it is recommended that this feature be reported for cancers arising in polyps as well as for stage I and II cases.</p>

                    <p><img src="reporting_images/table1.png" class="img-responsive" /><br/>Table. ITBCC Normalization Table for Reporting Tumor Budding According to Microscope.</p>
                    <p>To obtain tumor bud count for your field of view, divide by the normalization number.</p>
                    <h4>G.&nbsp; Polyps</h4>
                    <p>The adenocarcinoma can arise in adenomatous (tubular, tubulovillous, or villous) or serrated (sessile serrated adenoma/polyp or traditional serrated adenoma) polyp. Sessile serrated adenoma often develops cytologic dysplasia resembling tubular adenoma during neoplastic progression. These are presumed to be the precursors of right-sided adenocarcinomas with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H).<sup>40</sup></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h4>H.&nbsp; Perforation</h4>
                    <p>Tumor perforation is an uncommon complication of colorectal cancer, but one that is associated with a poor outcome, including high in-hospital mortality and morbidity.<sup>41</sup> Perforation of the uninvolved colon proximal to an obstructing tumor is also associated with high mortality because of generalized peritonitis and sepsis. Reported perforation rates range from 2.6% to 9%. Perforation is more likely to occur in older patients.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>I.&nbsp; Mesorectal Envelope</h5>
                    <p>The quality of the surgical technique is a key factor in the success of surgical treatment for rectal cancer, both in the prevention of local recurrence and in long-term survival. Numerous studies have demonstrated that total mesorectal excision (TME) improves local recurrence rates and the corresponding survival by as much as 20%. This surgical technique entails precise sharp dissection within the areolar plane outside (lateral to) the visceral mesorectal fascia to remove the rectum. This plane encases the rectum, its mesentery, and all regional nodes and constitutes Waldeyer&rsquo;s fascia. High-quality TME surgery reduces local recurrence from 20% to 30%, to 8% to 10% or less, and increases 5-year survival from 48% to 68%.<sup>42,43</sup> Adjuvant therapy in the presence of a high-quality TME may further reduce local recurrence (from 8% to 2.6%).<sup>44</sup></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Pathologic evaluation of the resection specimen has been shown to be a sensitive means of assessing the quality of rectal surgery. It is superior to indirect measures of surgical quality assessment, such as perioperative mortality, rates of complication, number of local recurrences, and 5-year survival. Macroscopic pathologic assessment of the completeness of the mesorectum, scored as complete, partially complete, or incomplete, accurately predicts both local recurrence and distant metastasis.<sup>43</sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup>Microscopic parameters, such as the status of the circumferential resection margin, the distance between the tumor and nearest circumferential margin (ie,&nbsp;&ldquo;surgical clearance&rdquo;), and the distance between the tumor and the closest distal margin, are all important predictors of local recurrence and may be affected by surgical technique.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The nonperitonealized surface of the fresh specimen is examined circumferentially, and the completeness of the mesorectum is scored as described below.<sup>43</sup> The entire specimen is scored according to the worst area.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>Incomplete</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Little bulk to the mesorectum</li>
                    <li>Defects in the mesorectum down to the muscularis propria</li>
                    <li>After transverse sectioning, the circumferential margin appears very irregular</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h5>Nearly Complete</h5>
                    <ul>

                    <li>Irregularity of the mesorectal surface with defects greater than 5 mm, but none extending to the muscularis propria</li>
                    <li>No areas of visibility of the muscularis propria except at the insertion site of the levator ani muscles</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Intact bulky mesorectum with a smooth surface</li>
                    <li>Only minor irregularities of the mesorectal surface</li>
                    <li>No surface defects greater than 5 mm in depth</li>
                    <li>No coning towards the distal margin of the specimen</li>
                    <li>After transverse sectioning, the circumferential margin appears smooth</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>J. Margins </h4>
                    <p>It may be helpful to mark the margin(s) closest to the tumor with ink following close examination of the serosal surface for puckering and other signs of tumor involvement. Margins marked by ink should be designated in the macroscopic description of the surgical pathology report. The serosal surface (visceral peritoneum) does not constitute a surgical margin.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In addition to addressing the proximal and distal margins, the radial margin (Figure 3A-3C) must be assessed for any segment either unencased (Figure 3C) or incompletely encased by peritoneum (Figure 3B) (see Note A). The radial margin represents the adventitial soft tissue margin closest to the deepest penetration of tumor and is created surgically by blunt or sharp dissection of the retroperitoneal or subperitoneal aspect, respectively. Since the lower rectum is entirely extraperitoneal, the radial margin extends circumferentially and has been referred to as the circumferential radial margin. Multivariate analysis has suggested that tumor involvement of the circumferential (radial) margin is the most critical factor in predicting local recurrence in rectal cancer.<sup>44</sup> A positive circumferential (radial) margin in rectal cancer increases the risk of recurrence by 3.5-fold and doubles the risk of death from disease. For this reason, the circumferential (radial) margin should be assessed in all rectal carcinomas as well as colonic segments with nonperitonealized surfaces. The circumferential (radial) margin is considered negative if the tumor is more than 1 mm from the inked nonperitonealized surface but should be recorded as positive if tumor is located 1 mm or less from the nonperitonealized surface, because local recurrence rates are similar with clearances of 0 to 1 mm. There is limited outcome data for cases with intranodal or intravascular tumor within 1 mm of radial resection margin, but follow-up based on a small number of patients suggests that local recurrence in these tumors may be similar to those with negative margin.<sup>44,45</sup></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C</p>

C, Circumferential margin (dotted line) in rectum, completely unencased by peritoneum.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The mesenteric resection margin (&lsquo;vascular tie&rsquo; margin) is the only relevant &lsquo;radial&rsquo; margin in segments completely encased by peritoneum (eg, transverse colon). Involvement of this margin should be reported even if tumor does not involve the serosal surface.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Sections to evaluate the proximal and distal resection margins can be obtained either by longitudinal sections perpendicular to the margin or by en face sections parallel to the margin. The distance from the tumor edge to the closest resection margin(s) may also be important, particularly for low anterior resections. For these cases, a distal resection margin of 2 cm is considered adequate; for T1 and T2 tumors, 1 cm may be sufficient distal clearance. Anastomotic recurrences are rare when the distance to the closest margin is 5 cm or greater.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In cases of carcinoma arising in a background of inflammatory bowel disease, proximal and distal resection margins should be evaluated for dysplasia and active inflammation. Proximal, distal, and radial/mesenteric resection margins should&nbsp;be reported in all resections specimens. Deep margin and mucosal margins should be reported in all transanal disk excisions.</p>
                    <h4>K. Treatment Effect  </h4>
                    <p>Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in rectal cancer is associated with significant tumor response and downstaging.<sup>46</sup> Because eradication of the tumor, as detected by pathologic examination of the resected specimen, is associated with a significantly better prognosis,<sup>47</sup> specimens from patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation should be thoroughly sectioned, with careful examination of the tumor site. Minimal residual disease has been shown to have a better prognosis than gross residual disease.<sup>48</sup> A modified Ryan scheme is suggested for scoring of tumor response, and has been shown to provide good interobserver reproducibility provide prognostic significance.<sup>49 </sup>Several other systems have been studied and can be chosen to report the tumor regression score.</p>

                    <p>
                        Surgical resection remains the most effective therapy for colorectal
                        carcinoma, and the best estimation of prognosis is derived from the
                        pathologic findings on the resection specimen. The anatomic extent of
                        disease is by far the most important prognostic factor in colorectal
                        cancer.

                    <p>
                        The protocol recommends the TNM staging system of the American Joint
                        Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer
                        (UICC)<sup>1</sup> but does not preclude the use of other staging systems.

                    <p>
                        By AJCC/UICC convention, the designation “T” refers to a primary tumor that
                        has not been previously treated. The symbol “p” refers to the pathologic
                        classification of the TNM, as opposed to the clinical classification, and
                        is based on gross and microscopic examination. pT entails a resection of
                        the primary tumor or biopsy adequate to evaluate the highest pT category,
                        pN entails removal or biopsy of nodes adequate to validate lymph node
                        metastasis, and pM implies microscopic examination of distant lesions.
                        Clinical classification (cTNM) is usually carried out by the referring
                        physician before treatment during initial evaluation of the patient or when
                        pathologic classification is not possible.

                        Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures macroscopically is
                        classified clinically as cT4. However, if no tumor is found within the
                        adhesion microscopically, the tumor should be assigned pT3.<sup>1</sup>

                        <u>Subdivision of T4 into T4a and T4b</u>
                        . Serosal (visceral peritoneal) involvement by tumor cells (pT4a) has been
                        demonstrated by multivariate analysis to have a negative impact on
                        prognosis,<sup>50,51 </sup>as does direct invasion of adjacent organs
                        (pT4b). Visceral peritoneal involvement can be missed without thorough
                        sampling and/or sectioning, and malignant cells have been identified in
                        serosal scrapings in as many as 26% of specimens categorized as pT3 by
                        histologic examination alone.<sup>52,53</sup> Although the absence of
                        standard guidelines for assessing peritoneal involvement may contribute to
                        underdiagnosis, the following findings are considered to represent serosal
                        involvement by tumor:

                            Free tumor cells on the serosal surface (on the visceral peritoneum)
                            with underlying erosion/ulceration of mesothelial lining, mesothelial
                            hyperplasia and/or inflammatory reaction<sup>51,52</sup>
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        · Perforation in which the tumor cells are continuous with the serosal
                        surface through inflammation
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The significance of tumors that are &lt;1 mm from the serosal surface and
                        accompanied by serosal reaction is unclear, with some<sup>52</sup> but not
                        all studies<sup>51</sup> indicating a higher risk of peritoneal recurrence.
                        Multiple level sections and/or additional section of the tumor should be
                        examined in these cases. If the serosal involvement is not present after
                        additional evaluation, the tumor should be assigned to the pT3 category.
                        The use of elastic stains has been advocated for identification of T4a
                        tumors by demonstrating tumor involvement of the subperitoneal elastic
                        lamina. The elastic stain can be difficult to interpret in this region and
                        the elastic lamina is not uniformly present even in normal colon. Hence
                        routine use of this stain is not considered standard practice. In portions
                        of the colorectum that are not peritonealized (eg, posterior aspects of
                        ascending and descending colon, lower portion of rectum), the T4a category
                        is not applicable.

                    <p>
                        Direct invasion in T4 includes invasion of other organs or other segments
                        of the colorectum as a result of direct extension through the serosa, as
                        confirmed on microscopic examination (for example, invasion of the sigmoid
                        colon by a carcinoma of the cecum) or, for cancers in a retroperitoneal or
                        subperitoneal location, direct invasion of other organs or structures by
                        virtue of extension beyond the muscularis propria (i.e., respectively, a
                        tumor on the posterior wall of the descending colon invading the left
                        kidney or lateral abdominal wall; or a mid or distal rectal cancer with
                        invasion of prostate, seminal vesicles, cervix, or vagina).

                        Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, grossly, is
                        classified cT4b. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion,
                        microscopically, the classification should be pT1-4a depending on the
                        anatomical depth of wall invasion. The V and L classifications should be
                        used to identify the presence or absence of vascular or lymphatic invasion
                        whereas the PN prognostic factor should be used for perineural invasion.

                        Intramural extension of tumor from one subsite (segment) of the large
                        intestine into an adjacent subsite or into the ileum (eg, for a cecal
                        carcinoma) or anal canal (eg, for a rectal carcinoma) does not affect the
                        pT classification. Transmural extension into another organ or site is
                        necessary for T4b designation.

                        Both types of peritoneal involvement are associated with decreased
                        survival. Although small studies suggested that serosal involvement was
                        associated with worse outcome than invasion of adjacent organs, data from a
                        large cohort of more than 100,000 colon cancer cases<sup>53</sup> indicate
                        that penetration of the visceral peritoneum carries a 10% to 20% better
                        5-year survival than locally invasive carcinomas for each category of N.

                        The likelihood of detecting metastasis increases with the number of lymph
                        nodes examined; hence 12 lymph nodes should be considered the minimum
                    target, but all possible lymph nodes should be retrieved and examined.    <sup>54,55</sup>

                    <p>
                    The clinical outcome is linked to lymph node harvest in stage II disease,    <sup> 56</sup> indicating a positive effect of optimal mesenteric resection
                        by the surgeon, optimal lymph node harvest from the resection specimen by
                        the pathologist, or both.

                    <p>
                        The number of lymph nodes recovered from a resection specimen is dependent
                        on several factors. Surgical technique, surgery volume, and patient factors
                        (eg, age and anatomic variation) alter the actual number of nodes in a
                        resection specimen, but the diligence and skill of the pathologist in
                        identifying and harvesting lymph nodes in the resection specimen also are
                        major factors. Lymph nodes may be more difficult to identify in specimens
                        from patients who are obese<sup>57</sup> or elderly, or after neoadjuvant
                        therapy.<sup>58 </sup>Because it has been shown that nodal metastasis in
                        colorectal cancer is often found in small lymph nodes (&lt;5 mm in
                        diameter), diligent search for lymph nodes is required on gross examination
                        of resection specimens. If fewer than 12 lymph nodes are found,
                        re-examining the specimen for additional lymph nodes, with or without
                        visual enhancement techniques, should be considered. The pathology report
                        should clearly state the total number of lymph nodes examined and the total
                        number involved by metastases. Data are insufficient to recommend routine
                        use of tissue levels or special/ancillary techniques.

                        <u>Nonregional Lymph Nodes</u>
                        . For microscopic examination of lymph nodes in large resection specimens,
                        lymph nodes must be designated as regional versus nonregional, according to
                        the anatomic location of the tumor. Metastasis to nonregional lymph nodes
                        is classified as distant metastasis and designated as M1.

                        <u>Lymph Nodes Replaced by Tumor</u>
                        . A tumor nodule in the pericolonic/perirectal fat without histologic
                        evidence of residual lymph node tissue is classified as a tumor deposit
                        (peritumoral deposit or satellite nodule) and is not considered a positive
                        lymph node. In the absence of unequivocal lymph node metastases, tumor
                        deposits are recorded as N1c.<sup>1</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Isolated Tumor Cells</u>
                        . Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small
                        clusters of tumor cells measuring 0.2 mm or less, usually found by special
                    techniques such as immunohistochemical staining, and are classified as N0.    <sup>1</sup> Because the biologic significance of ITCs (either a single
                        focus in a single node, multiple foci within a single or multiple nodes)
                        remains unproven, N0 is considered justified.<sup>59</sup> The number of
                        lymph nodes involved by ITCs should be clearly stated in a comment section
                        or elsewhere in the report. Metastatic deposits 0.2 mm-2.0 mm have been
                        referred to as micrometastasis. These nodes should be considered as
                        involved by cancer. A separate designation of micrometastasis (N1mi) can be
                        used, but is not necessary.<sup>1</sup>

                        Routine assessment of regional lymph nodes is limited to conventional
                        pathologic techniques (gross assessment and histologic examination), and
                        data are currently insufficient to recommend special measures to detect
                        ITCs. Thus, neither multiple levels of paraffin blocks nor the use of
                        special/ancillary techniques such as immunohistochemistry are recommended
                        for routine examination of regional lymph nodes.<sup> </sup>

                        Pathologic staging is usually performed after surgical resection of the
                        primary tumor. Pathologic staging depends on pathologic documentation of
                        the anatomic extent of disease, whether or not the primary tumor has been
                        completely removed. If a biopsied tumor is not resected for any reason (eg,
                        when technically unfeasible), and if the highest T and N categories or the
                        M1 category of the tumor can be confirmed microscopically, the criteria for
                        pathologic classification and staging have been satisfied without total
                        removal of the primary cancer.

                    <p>Universal testing for microsatellite instability and/or status DNA mismatch repair enzymes by immunohistochemistry is recommended by the EGAPP guidelines.<sup>60,61</sup> The NCCN guidelines also advocate this approach for patients &lt;70 years. MSI-high cancers are associated with right-sided location, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, Crohn-like infiltrate, pushing borders, mucinous/signet ring/medullary subtypes, intratumoral heterogeneity (mixed conventional, mucinous, and poorly differentiated carcinoma), high-grade histology, and lack of dirty necrosis.<sup>62,63</sup> In view of recommendations for universal testing and chance of missing cases of Lynch syndrome with testing based on Bethesda guidelines,<sup>63</sup> evaluation of histologic features associated with MSI is not required and is no longer included in the synoptic comment.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Since MSI-H cancers have a favorable prognosis, MSI testing for stage II cases can help in making decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy. Since MSI-H cancers do not respond well to 5-FU therapy, MSI status is also important in determining the choice of chemotherapeutic regimen.<sup>64</sup> &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Further details about mismatch repair enzyme immunohistochemistry and PCR for MSI testing, as well as other mutation testing in colorectal cancer (such as <em>KRAS</em>, <em>BRAF</em>) can be found in the CAP Colon and Rectum Biomarkers protocol.</p>
