                        <p>The transition from sigmoid to rectum is marked by the fusion of the tenia coli of the sigmoid to form the circumferential longitudinal muscle of the rectal wall approximately 12&nbsp;to 15 cm from the dentate line. The rectum is defined clinically as the distal large intestine commencing opposite the sacral promontory and ending at the anorectal ring, which corresponds to the proximal border of the puborectalis muscle palpable on digital rectal examination<sup>1</sup> (Figure 2). When measuring below with a rigid sigmoidoscope, it extends 16 cm from the anal verge.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Tumors located at the border between two subsites of the colon (eg, cecum and ascending colon) are registered as tumors of the subsite that is more involved. If two subsites are involved to the same extent, the tumor is classified as an "overlapping" lesion.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A tumor is classified as rectal if its inferior margin lies less than 16 cm from the anal verge or if any part of the tumor is located at least partly within the supply of the superior rectal artery.<sup>3 </sup>The rectum commences at the sacral promontory, and the junction of sigmoid colon and rectum is anatomically marked by fusion of tenia coli to form the circumferential longitudinal muscle of the rectal wall. Intraoperatively, the rectosigmoid junction corresponds to the sacral promontory. A tumor is classified as rectosigmoid when differentiation between rectum and sigmoid according to the previously mentioned guidelines is not possible.<sup>4 </sup></p>
                        <p><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>
                        <p>Anteriorly, the peritoneal reflection is located at the junction of middle and lower third of the rectum, while laterally, it is located at the junction of upper and middle third of the rectum. Posteriorly, the reflection is located higher and most of the posterior rectum does not have a serosal covering.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>(a) Whether an adenocarcinoma located in the rectum has a circumferential resection (radial) margin (CRM) or a peritoneal (serosal) surface depends on its location&nbsp;in relation&nbsp;to the peritoneal reflections. Tumors below the anterior peritoneal reflection will have a 360-degree CRM, while those above it may have a CRM or a peritoneal (serosal) surface, or both, depending on the precise location.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        (b) Neoadjuvant therapy and mesorectal excision&nbsp;are considered&nbsp;standard of care for rectal adenocarcinomas &ldquo;below the anterior peritoneal reflection,&rdquo; while the opinions about use of these modalities vary about rectal adenocarcinomas located above the anterior peritoneal reflection. Conservative options like transanal disc excisions are often considered for location &ldquo;below the anterior peritoneal reflection.&rdquo; In these contexts, the peritoneal reflection refers to the junction of upper and middle third of the rectum; there is ongoing debate in the surgical literature about the concept of peritoneal reflection.<sup>5</sup> If information about tumor location with respect to the peritoneal reflection is included in the report,&nbsp;the&nbsp;aspect of rectum in question (posterior, lateral, anterior)&nbsp;should also be noted.</li>

                    <p>The quality of the surgical technique is a key factor in the success of surgical treatment for rectal cancer, both in the prevention of local recurrence and in long-term survival. Numerous studies have demonstrated that total mesorectal excision (TME) improves local recurrence rates and the corresponding survival by as much as 20%. This surgical technique entails precise sharp dissection within the areolar plane outside (lateral to) the visceral mesorectal fascia to remove the rectum. This plane encases the rectum, its mesentery, and all regional nodes and constitutes Waldeyer&rsquo;s fascia. High-quality TME surgery reduces local recurrence from 20% to 30%, to 8% to 10% or less, and increases 5-year survival from 48% to 68%.<sup>42,43</sup> Adjuvant therapy in the presence of a high-quality TME may further reduce local recurrence (from 8% to 2.6%).<sup>44</sup></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Pathologic evaluation of the resection specimen has been shown to be a sensitive means of assessing the quality of rectal surgery. It is superior to indirect measures of surgical quality assessment, such as perioperative mortality, rates of complication, number of local recurrences, and 5-year survival. Macroscopic pathologic assessment of the completeness of the mesorectum, scored as complete, partially complete, or incomplete, accurately predicts both local recurrence and distant metastasis.<sup>43</sup> <sup>&nbsp;</sup>Microscopic parameters, such as the status of the circumferential resection margin, the distance between the tumor and nearest circumferential margin (ie,&nbsp;&ldquo;surgical clearance&rdquo;), and the distance between the tumor and the closest distal margin, are all important predictors of local recurrence and may be affected by surgical technique.</p>

                        <p>Medullary carcinoma is a distinctive histologic type strongly associated with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), indicative of defects in normal DNA repair gene function. Medullary carcinoma may occur either sporadically or in association with Lynch syndrome.<sup>9-11 </sup>This tumor type is characterized by solid growth in nested, organoid, or trabecular patterns, with no immunohistochemical evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation. Medullary carcinomas are also characterized by numerous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and a better prognosis.</p>

                        <p>Micropapillary carcinoma is characterized by small, tight clusters of tumor cells in cleft-like spaces, and is often present in association with conventional adenocarcinoma. This variant is strongly associated with lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis.<sup>12</sup></p>

                        <p>A number of grading systems for colorectal cancer have been suggested, but a single widely accepted and uniformly used standard for grading is lacking. Most systems stratify tumors into 3 or 4 grades as follows:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Grade 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well differentiated (&gt;95% gland formation)</p>
                        <p>Grade 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moderately differentiated (50-95% gland formation)</p>
                        <p>Grade 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poorly differentiated (&lt;50% gland formation)</p>
                        <p>Grade 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undifferentiated (no gland formation or mucin; no squamous or neuroendocrine differentiation)</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Despite a significant degree of interobserver variability<sup>14 </sup>histologic grade has been shown to be an important prognostic factor in many studies,<sup>15,16</sup> with strong correlation between poor differentiation and adverse outcome.<sup>17</sup> While some studies have stratified grade into a two-tiered low- and high-grade system, a three- or four-tier system is more commonly used for gastrointestinal carcinomas.&nbsp; The AJCC has specified use of a four-tiered grading system for colorectal cancer for the 8<sup>th</sup> edition of the TNM manual.<sup>1</sup> Pathologists should use the four-tier histologic grading scheme as specified above to prevent errors in data recording. As per WHO, the grading scheme applies to adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, and not to histologic variants. For example, medullary carcinomas behave as low grade tumors even though they may appear poorly differentiated. This grading scheme is also not applicable to poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas.</p>

                    <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>Colorectal adenomas containing invasive adenocarcinoma that extends through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa have been defined as <em>malignant polyps.</em><sup>14</sup> This term encompasses cases in which the entire polyp head is replaced by carcinoma and adenomas with focal malignancy, but the definition excludes adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma (invasive carcinoma limited to the lamina propria or invading no deeper than the muscularis mucosa), because these polyps possess negligible biological potential for metastasis (see Tis in Note M).</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Malignant polyps removed by endoscopic polypectomy require evaluation of histologic factors related to the risk of adverse outcome (ie, lymph node metastasis or local recurrence from residual malignancy) following polypectomy.<sup>18-20</sup> Factors shown to have independent prognostic significance and are important in determining the need for further surgical treatment include:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Histologic grade</li>
                    <li>Status of the resection margin</li>
                    <li>Lymphatic/venous vessel involvement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>An increased risk of adverse outcome has been shown to be associated with:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>High-grade carcinoma</li>
                    <li>Tumor at or less than 1 mm from the resection margin</li>
                    <li>Lymphatic/venous vessel involvement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Reporting of additional histologic factors that have been advocated for assessing risk include tumor budding (note F), depth or area of submucosal invasion. Submucosal involvement has been divided into superficial, mid and deep levels for sessile polyps (Kikuchi levels sm1, sm2 and sm3) for sessile polyps,<sup>21</sup> and into four levels (head, neck, stalk and beyond stalk) in pedunculated polyps (Haggitt levels).<sup>22</sup> Based on measurement, submucosal invasion more than 1mm has been recognized as an adverse prognostic factor.<sup>20</sup> However, it can be difficult to accurately assess the depth or extent of submucosal involvement due to improper orientation and absence of muscularis propria in these specimens.</p>

                    <p>It may be helpful to mark the margin(s) closest to the tumor with ink following close examination of the serosal surface for puckering and other signs of tumor involvement. Margins marked by ink should be designated in the macroscopic description of the surgical pathology report. The serosal surface (visceral peritoneum) does not constitute a surgical margin.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In addition to addressing the proximal and distal margins, the radial margin (Figure 3A-3C) must be assessed for any segment either unencased (Figure 3C) or incompletely encased by peritoneum (Figure 3B) (see Note A). The radial margin represents the adventitial soft tissue margin closest to the deepest penetration of tumor and is created surgically by blunt or sharp dissection of the retroperitoneal or subperitoneal aspect, respectively. Since the lower rectum is entirely extraperitoneal, the radial margin extends circumferentially and has been referred to as the circumferential radial margin. Multivariate analysis has suggested that tumor involvement of the circumferential (radial) margin is the most critical factor in predicting local recurrence in rectal cancer.<sup>44</sup> A positive circumferential (radial) margin in rectal cancer increases the risk of recurrence by 3.5-fold and doubles the risk of death from disease. For this reason, the circumferential (radial) margin should be assessed in all rectal carcinomas as well as colonic segments with nonperitonealized surfaces. The circumferential (radial) margin is considered negative if the tumor is more than 1 mm from the inked nonperitonealized surface but should be recorded as positive if tumor is located 1 mm or less from the nonperitonealized surface, because local recurrence rates are similar with clearances of 0 to 1 mm. There is limited outcome data for cases with intranodal or intravascular tumor within 1 mm of radial resection margin, but follow-up based on a small number of patients suggests that local recurrence in these tumors may be similar to those with negative margin.<sup>44,45</sup></p>

C, Circumferential margin (dotted line) in rectum, completely unencased by peritoneum.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The mesenteric resection margin (&lsquo;vascular tie&rsquo; margin) is the only relevant &lsquo;radial&rsquo; margin in segments completely encased by peritoneum (eg, transverse colon). Involvement of this margin should be reported even if tumor does not involve the serosal surface.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Sections to evaluate the proximal and distal resection margins can be obtained either by longitudinal sections perpendicular to the margin or by en face sections parallel to the margin. The distance from the tumor edge to the closest resection margin(s) may also be important, particularly for low anterior resections. For these cases, a distal resection margin of 2 cm is considered adequate; for T1 and T2 tumors, 1 cm may be sufficient distal clearance. Anastomotic recurrences are rare when the distance to the closest margin is 5 cm or greater.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In cases of carcinoma arising in a background of inflammatory bowel disease, proximal and distal resection margins should be evaluated for dysplasia and active inflammation. Proximal, distal, and radial/mesenteric resection margins should&nbsp;be reported in all resections specimens. Deep margin and mucosal margins should be reported in all transanal disk excisions.</p>

                    <h2>D.&nbsp; Carcinoma in an Adenomatous Polyp: Microscopic Tumor Extension and High-Risk Features</h2>
                    <p>Colorectal adenomas containing invasive adenocarcinoma that extends through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa have been defined as <em>malignant polyps.</em><sup>14</sup> This term encompasses cases in which the entire polyp head is replaced by carcinoma and adenomas with focal malignancy, but the definition excludes adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma (invasive carcinoma limited to the lamina propria or invading no deeper than the muscularis mucosa), because these polyps possess negligible biological potential for metastasis (see Tis in Note M).</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Malignant polyps removed by endoscopic polypectomy require evaluation of histologic factors related to the risk of adverse outcome (ie, lymph node metastasis or local recurrence from residual malignancy) following polypectomy.<sup>18-20</sup> Factors shown to have independent prognostic significance and are important in determining the need for further surgical treatment include:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Histologic grade</li>
                    <li>Status of the resection margin</li>
                    <li>Lymphatic/venous vessel involvement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>An increased risk of adverse outcome has been shown to be associated with:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>High-grade carcinoma</li>
                    <li>Tumor at or less than 1 mm from the resection margin</li>
                    <li>Lymphatic/venous vessel involvement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Reporting of additional histologic factors that have been advocated for assessing risk include tumor budding (note F), depth or area of submucosal invasion. Submucosal involvement has been divided into superficial, mid and deep levels for sessile polyps (Kikuchi levels sm1, sm2 and sm3) for sessile polyps,<sup>21</sup> and into four levels (head, neck, stalk and beyond stalk) in pedunculated polyps (Haggitt levels).<sup>22</sup> Based on measurement, submucosal invasion more than 1mm has been recognized as an adverse prognostic factor.<sup>20</sup> However, it can be difficult to accurately assess the depth or extent of submucosal involvement due to improper orientation and absence of muscularis propria in these specimens.</p>
                    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
                    <h2>E.&nbsp; Lymph-Vascular and Perineural Invasion</h2>
                    <p>It is recommended that small vessel vascular invasion should be reported separately from venous (large vessel) invasion. Small vessel invasion indicates tumor involvement of thin-walled structures lined by endothelium, without an identifiable smooth muscle layer or elastic lamina. Small vessels include lymphatics, capillaries, and postcapillary venules. Small vessel invasion is associated with lymph node metastasis and has been shown to be independent indicator of adverse outcome in several studies.<sup>23,24</sup> The higher prognostic significance of extramural small vessel invasion has been suggested,<sup>25</sup> but the importance of anatomic location in small vessel invasion (extramural or intramural) is not well defined.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Tumor involving endothelium-lined spaces with an identifiable smooth muscle layer or elastic lamina is considered venous (large vessel) invasion. Circumscribed tumor nodules surrounded by an elastic lamina on hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) or elastic stain are also considered venous invasion. Venous invasion can be extramural (beyond muscularis propria) or intramural (submucosa or muscularis propria). Extramural venous invasion has been demonstrated by multivariate analysis to be an independent adverse prognostic factor in multiple studies and is a risk factor for liver metastasis.<sup>25</sup> The significance of intramural venous invasion is less clear. Histologic features like tumor deposits adjacent to arterioles (&ldquo;orphan arteriole&rdquo; sign) and elongated tumor nodules extending into pericolic fat from the muscularis propria (&ldquo;protruding tongue&rdquo; sign) can raise the suspicion for venous invasion.<sup>26</sup> Elastic stain can lead to 2- to 3-fold increase in the detection of venous invasion, and may be used to improve assessment of this feature.<sup>27</sup></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Perineural invasion has been shown to be independent indicator of poor prognosis.<sup>28-30</sup> While some series did not find perineural invasion to be a significant predictive factor in stage II disease,<sup>31,32</sup> many studies have confirmed its adverse effect on survival in stage II disease.<sup>24,33</sup> Extramural perineural invasion may have a greater adverse prognostic effect,<sup>29</sup> but the distinction between intramural and extramural perineural invasion has not been well studied.</p>

                    <p>The presence of single cells or small clusters of less than five cells at the advancing front of the tumor is considered as peritumoral tumor budding. Numerous studies have shown that high tumor budding in adenocarcinoma arising in polyp is a significant risk factor for nodal involvement,<sup>20,34-38</sup> with tumor budding being the most significant factor in some studies.<sup>35</sup> Similarly, the adverse prognosis of high tumor budding has been shown in stage II patients and its inclusion as a high risk factor for making chemotherapy decisions for stage II patients has been advocated.<sup>36,38</sup> Different criteria for evaluating and reporting tumor budding have been followed in literature. An international tumor budding consensus conference (ITBCC) in 2016 recommended the following criteria for evaluating tumor budding<sup>39</sup>:</p>
                    <p>(1) Tumor budding counts should be done on H&amp;E sections. In cases of obscuring factors like inflammation, immunohistochemistry for keratin can be obtained to assess the advancing edge for tumor buds, but the scoring should be done on H&amp;E sections.</p>
                    <p>(2) Tumor budding should be reported by selecting a &ldquo;hotspot&rdquo; chosen after review of all available slides with invasive tumor. The total number of buds should be reported in an area measuring 0.785 mm<sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to 20x field in some microscopes (use appropriate conversion for other microscopes, see table below).</p>
                    <p>(3) Both total number of buds and a three-tier score (based on 0.785 mm<sup>2 </sup>field area) should be reported: low (0-4 &nbsp;buds), intermediate (5-9 buds) and high (10 or more buds).</p>
                    <p>This is not a required element, but it is recommended that this feature be reported for cancers arising in polyps as well as for stage I and II cases.</p>

                        (mesocolic or rectal fat) within the lymph drainage area of the primary
                        tumor, but without identifiable lymph node tissue or vascular structure. If
                        the vessel wall or its remnant is identified (H&amp;E, elastic, or any
                        other stain), it should be classified as vascular (venous) invasion, and
                        not as tumor deposit. Similarly, a tumor focus is present in or around a
                        large nerve, should be classified as perineural invasion and not as tumor
                        deposit. Size and shape of the tumor focus are not relevant for

                        The presence of tumor deposits in the absence of any regional node
                        involvement is categorized as N1c, irrespective of T category. Tumor
                        deposits are an adverse prognostic factor<sup>49,50</sup> and adjuvant
                        therapy is generally warranted in cases that are categorized as N1c
                        regardless of T classification. The number of tumor deposits should be
                        recorded. If tumor deposits are accompanied by identifiable lymph node
                        metastasis (including micrometastasis), it does not affect the N category,
                        which is then determined by the number of positive lymph nodes (see note
                        M).

                    <p>

                        Surgical resection remains the most effective therapy for colorectal
                        carcinoma, and the best estimation of prognosis is derived from the
                        pathologic findings on the resection specimen. The anatomic extent of
                        disease is by far the most important prognostic factor in colorectal
                        cancer.

                        The protocol recommends the TNM staging system of the American Joint
                        Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer
                        (UICC)<sup>1</sup> but does not preclude the use of other staging systems.

                        By AJCC/UICC convention, the designation “T” refers to a primary tumor that
                        has not been previously treated. The symbol “p” refers to the pathologic
                        classification of the TNM, as opposed to the clinical classification, and
                        is based on gross and microscopic examination. pT entails a resection of
                        the primary tumor or biopsy adequate to evaluate the highest pT category,
                        pN entails removal or biopsy of nodes adequate to validate lymph node
                        metastasis, and pM implies microscopic examination of distant lesions.
                        Clinical classification (cTNM) is usually carried out by the referring
                        physician before treatment during initial evaluation of the patient or when
                        pathologic classification is not possible.

                        For identification of special cases of TNM or pTNM classifications, the “m”
                        suffix and “y” and “r” prefixes are used. Although they do not affect the
                        stage grouping, they indicate cases needing separate analysis.

                    <p>
                        <u>The “m” suffix</u>
                        indicates the presence of multiple primary tumors in a single site and is
                        recorded in parentheses: pT(m)NM.

                    <p>
                        <u>The “y” prefix</u>
                        indicates those cases in which classification is performed during or
                        following initial multimodality therapy (ie, neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
                        radiation therapy, or both chemotherapy and radiation therapy). The cTNM or
                        pTNM category is identified by a “y” prefix. The ycTNM or ypTNM categorizes
                        the extent of tumor actually present at the time of that examination. The
                        “y” categorization is not an estimate of tumor prior to multimodality
                        therapy (ie, before initiation of neoadjuvant therapy).

                        <u>The “r” prefix</u>
                        indicates a recurrent tumor when staged after a documented disease-free
                        interval, and is identified by the “r” prefix: rTNM.

                        extension through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa is classified

                        Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures macroscopically is
                        classified clinically as cT4. However, if no tumor is found within the
                        adhesion microscopically, the tumor should be assigned pT3.<sup>1</sup>

                        . Serosal (visceral peritoneal) involvement by tumor cells (pT4a) has been
                        demonstrated by multivariate analysis to have a negative impact on
                        prognosis,<sup>50,51 </sup>as does direct invasion of adjacent organs
                        (pT4b). Visceral peritoneal involvement can be missed without thorough
                        sampling and/or sectioning, and malignant cells have been identified in
                        serosal scrapings in as many as 26% of specimens categorized as pT3 by
                        histologic examination alone.<sup>52,53</sup> Although the absence of
                        standard guidelines for assessing peritoneal involvement may contribute to
                        underdiagnosis, the following findings are considered to represent serosal
                        involvement by tumor:

                            Free tumor cells on the serosal surface (on the visceral peritoneum)
                            with underlying erosion/ulceration of mesothelial lining, mesothelial
                            hyperplasia and/or inflammatory reaction<sup>51,52</sup>
                        </li>

                        · Perforation in which the tumor cells are continuous with the serosal
                        surface through inflammation

                    <p>
                        The significance of tumors that are &lt;1 mm from the serosal surface and
                        accompanied by serosal reaction is unclear, with some<sup>52</sup> but not
                        all studies<sup>51</sup> indicating a higher risk of peritoneal recurrence.
                        Multiple level sections and/or additional section of the tumor should be
                        examined in these cases. If the serosal involvement is not present after
                        additional evaluation, the tumor should be assigned to the pT3 category.
                        The use of elastic stains has been advocated for identification of T4a
                        tumors by demonstrating tumor involvement of the subperitoneal elastic
                        lamina. The elastic stain can be difficult to interpret in this region and
                        the elastic lamina is not uniformly present even in normal colon. Hence
                        routine use of this stain is not considered standard practice. In portions
                        of the colorectum that are not peritonealized (eg, posterior aspects of
                        ascending and descending colon, lower portion of rectum), the T4a category
                        is not applicable.

                    <p>
                        Direct invasion in T4 includes invasion of other organs or other segments
                        of the colorectum as a result of direct extension through the serosa, as
                        confirmed on microscopic examination (for example, invasion of the sigmoid
                        colon by a carcinoma of the cecum) or, for cancers in a retroperitoneal or
                        subperitoneal location, direct invasion of other organs or structures by
                        virtue of extension beyond the muscularis propria (i.e., respectively, a
                        tumor on the posterior wall of the descending colon invading the left
                        kidney or lateral abdominal wall; or a mid or distal rectal cancer with

                        Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, grossly, is

                        microscopically, the classification should be pT1-4a depending on the
                        anatomical depth of wall invasion. The V and L classifications should be
                        used to identify the presence or absence of vascular or lymphatic invasion
                        whereas the PN prognostic factor should be used for perineural invasion.

                        Both types of peritoneal involvement are associated with decreased
                        survival. Although small studies suggested that serosal involvement was
                        associated with worse outcome than invasion of adjacent organs, data from a
                        large cohort of more than 100,000 colon cancer cases<sup>53</sup> indicate
                        that penetration of the visceral peritoneum carries a 10% to 20% better
                        5-year survival than locally invasive carcinomas for each category of N.

                        For rectal cancers, metastasis in the external iliac or common iliac nodes
                        is classified as distant metastasis.<sup>1</sup>

                        <u>Submission of Lymph Nodes for Microscopic Examination. </u>
                        All grossly negative or equivocal lymph nodes should be submitted entirely.
                        Grossly positive lymph nodes may be partially submitted for microscopic
                        confirmation of metastasis.

                        The accuracy and predictive value of stage II assignment are directly
                        proportional to the thoroughness of the surgical technique in removing all
                        regional nodes and the pathologic examination of the resection specimen in
                        identifying and harvesting all regional lymph nodes for microscopic
                        assessment. The National Quality Forum lists the presence of at least 12
                        lymph nodes in a surgical resection among the key quality measures for
                        colon cancer care in the United States (see
                        http://www.facs.org/cancer/qualitymeasures.html).

                    <p>
                        The likelihood of detecting metastasis increases with the number of lymph
                        nodes examined; hence 12 lymph nodes should be considered the minimum
                    target, but all possible lymph nodes should be retrieved and examined.    <sup>54,55</sup>

                    <p>
                    The clinical outcome is linked to lymph node harvest in stage II disease,    <sup> 56</sup> indicating a positive effect of optimal mesenteric resection
                        by the surgeon, optimal lymph node harvest from the resection specimen by
                        the pathologist, or both.

                    <p>
                        The number of lymph nodes recovered from a resection specimen is dependent
                        on several factors. Surgical technique, surgery volume, and patient factors
                        (eg, age and anatomic variation) alter the actual number of nodes in a
                        resection specimen, but the diligence and skill of the pathologist in
                        identifying and harvesting lymph nodes in the resection specimen also are
                        major factors. Lymph nodes may be more difficult to identify in specimens
                        from patients who are obese<sup>57</sup> or elderly, or after neoadjuvant
                        therapy.<sup>58 </sup>Because it has been shown that nodal metastasis in
                        colorectal cancer is often found in small lymph nodes (&lt;5 mm in
                        diameter), diligent search for lymph nodes is required on gross examination
                        of resection specimens. If fewer than 12 lymph nodes are found,
                        re-examining the specimen for additional lymph nodes, with or without
                        visual enhancement techniques, should be considered. The pathology report
                        should clearly state the total number of lymph nodes examined and the total
                        number involved by metastases. Data are insufficient to recommend routine
                        use of tissue levels or special/ancillary techniques.

                        <u>Nonregional Lymph Nodes</u>
                        . For microscopic examination of lymph nodes in large resection specimens,
                        lymph nodes must be designated as regional versus nonregional, according to
                        the anatomic location of the tumor. Metastasis to nonregional lymph nodes
                        is classified as distant metastasis and designated as M1.

                        <u>Lymph Nodes Replaced by Tumor</u>
                        . A tumor nodule in the pericolonic/perirectal fat without histologic
                        evidence of residual lymph node tissue is classified as a tumor deposit
                        (peritumoral deposit or satellite nodule) and is not considered a positive
                        lymph node. In the absence of unequivocal lymph node metastases, tumor
                        deposits are recorded as N1c.<sup>1</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <u>Isolated Tumor Cells</u>
                        . Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) are defined as single tumor cells or small
                        clusters of tumor cells measuring 0.2 mm or less, usually found by special
                    techniques such as immunohistochemical staining, and are classified as N0.    <sup>1</sup> Because the biologic significance of ITCs (either a single
                        focus in a single node, multiple foci within a single or multiple nodes)
                        remains unproven, N0 is considered justified.<sup>59</sup> The number of
                        lymph nodes involved by ITCs should be clearly stated in a comment section
                        or elsewhere in the report. Metastatic deposits 0.2 mm-2.0 mm have been
                        referred to as micrometastasis. These nodes should be considered as
                        involved by cancer. A separate designation of micrometastasis (N1mi) can be
                        used, but is not necessary.<sup>1</sup>

                        Routine assessment of regional lymph nodes is limited to conventional
                        pathologic techniques (gross assessment and histologic examination), and
                        data are currently insufficient to recommend special measures to detect
                        ITCs. Thus, neither multiple levels of paraffin blocks nor the use of
                        special/ancillary techniques such as immunohistochemistry are recommended
                        for routine examination of regional lymph nodes.<sup> </sup>

                        Pathologic staging is usually performed after surgical resection of the
                        primary tumor. Pathologic staging depends on pathologic documentation of
                        the anatomic extent of disease, whether or not the primary tumor has been
                        completely removed. If a biopsied tumor is not resected for any reason (eg,
                        when technically unfeasible), and if the highest T and N categories or the
                        M1 category of the tumor can be confirmed microscopically, the criteria for
                        pathologic classification and staging have been satisfied without total
                        removal of the primary cancer.

                        <p>The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system maintained collaboratively by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) is recommended. Assignment of Pathologic Prognostic Stage Group is the responsibility of the managing physician <br/> <strong>Pathologic Classification</strong><br/>The pathologic classification of a cancer is based on information acquired before treatment supplemented and modified by the additional evidence acquired during and from surgery, particularly from pathologic examination of resected tissues. The pathologic classification provides additional precise and objective data. Classification of T, N, and M by pathologic means is denoted by use of a lower case “p” prefix (pT, pN, pM).<br/>Pathologic T (pT): The pathologic assessment of the primary tumor (pT) generally is based on resection of the primary tumor generally from a single specimen. Resection of the tumor with several partial removals at the same or separate operations necessitates an effort at reasonable estimates of the size and extension of the tumor to assign the correct or highest pT category. On rare occasions, the tumor size is obtained from a previous core needle biopsy specimen, as the tumor in the core may be larger than the tumor in the excision specimen.<br/> AJCC/UICC definition of inflammatory carcinoma (T4d): Inflammatory carcinoma is a clinical-pathologic entity characterized by diffuse erythema and edema (peau d’orange) involving one-third or more of the skin of the breast. The skin changes are due to lymphedema caused by tumor emboli within dermal lymphatics, which may or may not be obvious in a small skin biopsy. However, a tissue diagnosis is still necessary to demonstrate an invasive carcinoma in the underlying breast parenchyma or at least in the dermal lymphatics, as well as to determine biological markers, such as ER, PgR, and HER2 status. Tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics without the clinical skin changes described above do not qualify as inflammatory carcinoma. Locally advanced breast cancers directly invading the dermis or ulcerating the skin without the clinical skin changes also do not qualify as inflammatory carcinoma. Thus, the term inflammatory carcinoma should not be applied to neglected locally advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in the course of a patient’s disease. The rare case that exhibits all the features of inflammatory carcinoma, but in which skin changes involve less than one-third of the skin, should be classified by the size and extent of the underlying carcinoma. <br/> Pathologic N (pN): The pathologic assessment of regional lymph nodes (pN) ideally requires resection of a minimum number of lymph nodes to assure that there is sufficient sampling to identify positive nodes if present. The recommended number generally does not apply in cases where sentinel node has been accepted as accurate for defining regional node involvement and a sentinel node procedure has been performed. At least 1 node with presence or absence of cancer documented by pathologic examination is required for pathologic N classification. <br/> Direct extension of primary tumor into a regional node is classified as node positive. A tumor nodule with a smooth contour in a regional node area is classified as a positive node. The size of the metastasis, not the size of the node, is used for the criterion for the N category.<br/> Specialized pathologic techniques such as immunohistochemistry or molecular techniques may identify limited metastases in lymph nodes that may not have been identified without the use of the special diagnostic techniques. Single tumor cells or small clusters of cells are classified as isolated tumor cells (ITCs). The standard definition for ITCs is a cluster of cells not more than 0.2 mm in greatest diameter. Cases with ITCs only in lymph nodes are classified as pN0. This rule also generally applies to cases with findings of tumor cells or their components by nonmorphologic techniques such as flow cytometry or DNA analysis. <br/>AJCC/UICC definition of isolated tumor cells: Isolated tumor cell clusters (ITC) are defined as small clusters of cells not greater than 0.2 mm or single tumor cells, or fewer than 200 cells in a single histologic cross-section. ITCs may be detected by routine histology or by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods. Nodes containing only ITCs are excluded from the total positive node count for purposes of N classification but should be included in the total number of nodes evaluated <br/> Approximately 1000 tumor cells are contained in a 3-dimensional 0.2-mm cluster. Thus, if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single dispersed tumor cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in a single histologic section of a lymph node, there is a high probability that more than 1000 cells are present in the lymph node. In these situations, the node should be classified as containing a micrometastasis (pN1mi). Cells in different lymph node cross-sections or longitudinal sections or levels of the block are not added together; the 200 cells must be in a single node profile even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices. It is recognized that there is substantial overlap between the upper limit of the ITC and the lower limit of the micrometastasis categories due to inherent limitations in pathologic nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden in lymph nodes. Thus, the threshold of 200 cells in a single cross-section is a guideline to help pathologists distinguish between these 2 categories. The pathologist should use judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster of cells represents a true micrometastasis or is simply a small group of isolated tumor cells. <br/> Pathologic M (pM): The pathologic assignment of the presence of metastases (pM1) requires histologic confirmation of cancer at the metastatic site. The designation MX has been eliminated from the AJCC/UICC TNM system. Pathologic M0 is an undefined concept, and the category “pM0” may not be used. Pathologic classification of the absence of distant metastases can only be made at autopsy. Cases with a biopsy of a possible metastatic site that shows ITCs such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or disseminated tumor cells (DTCs), or bone marrow micrometastases detected by IHC or molecular techniques, are classified as M0(i+) to denote the uncertain prognostic significance of these findings, and to classify the stage group according to the T and N and M0. <br/> Posttherapy or post-neoadjuvant therapy classification (yTNM): Cases for which systemic and/or radiation therapy are given before surgery (“neoadjuvant”) or for which no surgery is performed may have the extent of disease assessed at the conclusion of the therapy by clinical or pathologic means (if resection performed). This classification is useful to clinicians because the extent of response to therapy may provide important prognostic information to patients and help direct the extent of surgery or subsequent systemic and/or radiation therapy. T and N are classified by using the same categories as for clinical or pathologic staging for the disease type, and the findings are recorded by using the prefix designator “y” (eg, ycT; ycN; ypT; ypN). The “yc” prefix is used for the clinical stage after therapy, and the “yp” prefix is used for the pathologic stage for those cases that have surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy. The M component should be classified by the M status defined pathologically prior to therapy. <br/> Retreatment classification (rTNM): This classification is assigned when further treatment is planned for a cancer that recurs after a disease-free interval. The original stage assigned at the time of initial diagnosis and treatment does not change when the cancer recurs or progresses. The use of this staging for retreatment or recurrence is denoted with the "r" prefix (rTNM). All information available at the time of retreatment should be used in determining the rTNM stage. <br/>Multiple tumors: When there are multiple simultaneous tumors of the same histology in 1 organ, the tumor with the highest T category is the one selected for classification and staging, and the multiplicity or the number of tumors is indicated in parentheses: for example, T2(m) or T2(5). For simultaneous bilateral cancers in paired organs, the tumors are classified separately as independent tumors in different organs. <br/> Metachronous primaries: Second or subsequent primary cancers occurring in the same organ or in different organs are staged as a new cancer with the TNM system. Second cancers are not staged using the “y” prefix unless the treatment of the second cancer warrants this use. <br/> Residual tumor and surgical margins: The absence or presence of residual tumor after treatment is described by the symbol “R.”  cTNM and pTNM describe the extent of cancer in general without consideration of treatment. cTNM and pTNM can be supplemented by the R classification, which deals with the tumor status after treatment. In some cases treated with surgery and/or with neoadjuvant therapy, there will be residual tumor at the primary site after treatment because of incomplete resection or local and regional disease that extends beyond the limit or ability of resection. The presence of residual tumor may indicate the effect of therapy, influence further therapy, and be a strong predictor of prognosis. In addition, the presence or absence of disease at the margin of resection may be a predictor of the risk of recurrent cancer. The presence of residual disease or positive margins may be more likely with more advanced T or N category tumors. The R category is not incorporated into TNM staging itself. However, the absence or presence of residual tumor and status of the margins may be recorded in the medical record and cancer registry.</p>

                        <p>The R categories for the primary tumor site are: <br/>R0	No residual tumor <br/>R1	Microscopic residual tumor <br/>R2	Macroscopic residual tumor <br/>RX	Presence of residual tumor cannot be assessed </p>

                        <p>The margin status may be recorded using the following categories:<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Negative margins (tumor not present at surgical margin)</li>
                            <li>Microscopic positive margin (tumor not identified grossly at the margin, but present microscopically at the margin)</li>
                            <li>Macroscopic positive margin (tumor identified grossly at the margin)</li>
                            <li>Margin not assessed</li>
                        </ul>

                    Universal testing for microsatellite instability and/or status DNA mismatch
                    repair enzymes by immunohistochemistry is recommended by the EGAPP
                    guidelines.<sup>60,61</sup> The NCCN guidelines also advocate this approach
                    for patients &lt;70 years. MSI-high cancers are associated with right-sided
                    location, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, Crohn-like infiltrate, pushing
                    borders, mucinous/signet ring/medullary subtypes, intratumoral
                    heterogeneity (mixed conventional, mucinous, and poorly differentiated
                carcinoma), high-grade histology, and lack of dirty necrosis.    <sup>62,63</sup> In view of recommendations for universal testing and
                    chance of missing cases of Lynch syndrome with testing based on Bethesda
                    guidelines,<sup>63</sup> evaluation of histologic features associated with
                    MSI is not required and is no longer included in the synoptic comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since MSI-H cancers have a favorable prognosis, MSI testing for stage II
                    cases can help in making decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy. Since
                    MSI-H cancers do not respond well to 5-FU therapy, MSI status is also
                important in determining the choice of chemotherapeutic regimen.    <sup>64</sup>
